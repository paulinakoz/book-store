Started the project by installing all the dependencies using Spring Boot.

Dependencies added:
- Spring Web
- Spring Boot DevTools
- Spring Data JPA
- Lombok
- H2 Database

Created the first rest controller which for now just displays a list of books.
Experienced a bug when trying to push the project to github as I was getting an authentication error
but I resolved it by googling the error and implementing the recommended fix.
